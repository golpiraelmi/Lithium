Dataset contained chemical analysis of water samples for oil-field brines for over 600000 wells in Alberta. The project included data cleaning (removing duplicate entries, imputing missing values, normalizing, and scaling geochemical data as well as finding outliers), data visualization, conducting principle component analysis for dimension reduction. In addition, multiple machine learning algorithms were built (including K-NN, Neural Network, and support vector machine) and tuned and the best algorithm was selected. This project has been carried out with python libraries such as SKlearn, Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy, as well as IBM SPSS Modeller for Neural Network algorithm.
